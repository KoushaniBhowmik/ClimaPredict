Components and Their Names:
1. Raspberry Pi 4: The central processing unit for the system, responsible for collecting data from sensors and processing it.
2. GPIO Extension Board: A breakout board for the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins that simplifies wiring.
3. Rain Sensor (YL-83): Detects rainfall and provides analog/digital output based on water presence.
4. DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.
5. LDR Sensor: Measures light intensity based on resistance changes due to light exposure.
6. ADS7830 ADC Module: An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) used to convert analog signals from the rain sensor and LDR into digital signals for the Raspberry Pi.
7. LCD Screen (16x2): Displays the weather data in real-time.
8. I2C Module (PCF8574): An interface module for the LCD, reducing the number of GPIO pins required to connect the display.
9. Connecting Wires: Used to connect components to the GPIO pins or the GPIO Extension Board.
10. GPIO Ribbon Cable: Connects the Raspberry Pi to the GPIO Extension Board.



Component Connections
1. Rain Sensor
VCC (Power): Connect to the 5V pin of the Raspberry Pi (via GPIO Extension Board).
GND (Ground): Connect to the GND pin on the GPIO Extension Board.
Output Pin (Signal): Connect to one of the analog input pins of the ADS7830 ADC Module.

2. DHT11 Sensor
VCC (Power): Connect to the 5V pin on the GPIO Extension Board.
GND (Ground): Connect to the GND pin on the GPIO Extension Board.
Data Pin: Connect to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi (e.g., GPIO17).

3. LDR Sensor
VCC (Power): Connect to the 5V pin on the GPIO Extension Board.
GND (Ground): Connect to the GND pin on the GPIO Extension Board.
Output Pin (Signal): Connect to another analog input pin of the ADS7830 ADC Module.

4. ADS7830 ADC Module: The ADS7830 is necessary to convert the analog signals from the rain sensor and LDR into digital data for the Raspberry Pi.
VCC (Power): Connect to the 5V pin of the Raspberry Pi.
GND (Ground): Connect to the GND pin on the GPIO Extension Board.
SCL (Clock): Connect to GPIO3 (SCL).
SDA (Data): Connect to GPIO2 (SDA).
Analog Inputs:
Connect the Rain Sensor's output pin to one analog input (e.g., A0).
Connect the LDR Sensor's output pin to another analog input (e.g., A1).

5. LCD Screen with I2C Module: The I2C module simplifies communication between the LCD and Raspberry Pi by using only two GPIO pins.
VCC (Power): Connect to the 5V pin on the GPIO Extension Board.
GND (Ground): Connect to the GND pin on the GPIO Extension Board.
SCL (Clock): Connect to GPIO3 (SCL).
SDA (Data): Connect to GPIO2 (SDA).

6. GPIO Extension Board
Attach the GPIO Ribbon Cable from the Raspberry Pi to the GPIO Extension Board. This simplifies the wiring and avoids direct connections to the Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO pins.

7. Use the extension board's pins to connect components like sensors, the ADC module, and the LCD screen.

8. Powering the System
Power the Raspberry Pi 4 using a Type-C power adapter.
All other components draw power (5V) and ground (GND) from the GPIO Extension Board.
